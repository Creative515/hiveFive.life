# Our Mission

​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At **hiveFive|life** strive to make the best use of the abundance of non-renewable resources that are produced everyday. These resources, once created, will be lost if not harnessed. We believe it is our duty as a community to prevent the waste of such resources and we dedicate ourselves to making the very best of everything our world produces.

## Mining Crypto-Currencies for a Cause
​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world is switching away from fossil fuels one of the largest concerns is how to store energy. Solar and wind farms produce high-outputs of electricity but are very sporadic when It comes to timing. As a result, some locations have seen up to 48% of the electricity produced go to waste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't the first thing that comes up in conversation when someone mentions non-renewable resources at a party, but computing power is wasted at an extraordinary rate and is one of the great losses of our age. The general user consumes at most 20% of the computing power of a modern device even during heavy use. This number shrinks exponentially when you look at small to midsize businesses that invest in high-end compute servers that function the majority of the time as file-fetchers, using mere fractions of their potential computing powers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do is help bridge the gap between the needs of the modern electrical grid and the billions of devices left sitting unused. We do this by utilizing one of mankind's newest technologies, the "Proof-of-Work" crypto-currency.

### The Technical Bit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crypto-Currencies generally are a new type of internet protocol similar to TCIP and BitTorrent used for synchronizing data across many servers. One of the main features of these new protocols are that they enable a new immutable data-type, meaning that it is data that once propagated to the network, can never again be edited.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crypto-Currencies have found different ways to make this new immutable data-type possible, however we are focusing on one type in particular, referred to commonly as "Proof-of-Work". In this type of crypto-currency the data is verified by solving complex mathematical equations  with your electronic devices processor. These math problems are designed in a way that they cannot be solved without using a specific amount of processing power. The data is also propagated in an hierarchical fashion designed so that in order to change a piece of data on the network one would need more computing power than the sum of all of the computing power it took to solve the math problems associated with the each piece of data propagated after the data being changed. By knowing the efficiency of the device performing the computational work, the exact amount of electricity it takes to change any piece data on the network can be determined.

### Putting It All Together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are using your excess computing power and the power grids excess electricity to solve the complex mathematical equations that secure the crypto-currencies, this is called "mining". As you may have heard, "Miners" of crypto-currencies make oodles of cash! Well, that might be the case for those that have invested millions of dollars into fancy mining equipment, but for someone mining with a cellphone or even a very high-end gaming desktop there are mere pennies to be made. Unless, that is, we all work together. We take every device running our software and combine their computing power into one massive force for change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hive-mind supercomputer works 24hrs a day in hopes of generating a small fortune. Which we here a **hiveFive|life** will donate **in full** to the causes that our generous users select.






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sticking with our mission, our first product claims the unused technological power and electricity form our home computers, cellphones, business computers and other electronic devices and uses it to mine for cryptocurrencies. 

​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mining is a process that uses our users extra computing power to secure cryptocurrency transactions. For the added security, users of the cryptocurrencies pay us small fees in return. A single desktop computer mining alone on a cryptocurrency network can sometimes generate a few cent (USD) a month, but by aggregating together hundreds or thousands of computers and other devices we hope generate substantial fees from the cryptocurrencies network. 

​    Again, in sticking with our mission, one of the key resources that we believe is going unused is peoples willingness to help one another. So, to make use of this resource we have decided to give all of the fees collected form our users mining to a cause that our users select.

## The Process

​     First, users submit causes that they would like to see donated to as a comment in our forums found at the "COMMUNITY!" page. After going through a quick reviewing process, nearing the end of our five month "round" we will create a poll on the forum where users can vote for the causes they want to see make it to the front page. Lastly, the top-five cause from the forum poll will make it to the front page poll, where over the course of the next five months there will be a continuous competition to see which cause will receive the lions-share of the donations.
