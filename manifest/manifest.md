## <center> Our Mission
-------------
​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At **hiveFive|life** we strive to make the best use of the abundance of renewable resources that are produced everyday. These resources, once created, will be lost if not harnessed. We believe it is our duty as a community to prevent the waste of such resources and we dedicate ourselves to making the very best of everything our world produces.

### The Problem
​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world is switching away from fossil fuels one of the largest concerns is how to make use of energy while it is available. Solar and wind farms produce high-outputs of electricity but are very sporadic when it comes to timing. Solar farms only produce powder when the sun is out, wind farms only when there is wind. As a result, some regions like China have seen [35% wind energy curtailment on average over recent years](https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2017/04/19/china-wind-solar-renewable-curtailment-energy-wasted/), up to 48% total renewable energy curtailment in some locals. This means that energy production is being haulted because there is more available than we can either use or store. [According to Greenpeace, China wasted more wind energy last year that Sweeden produced in 2015](https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2017/04/19/china-wind-solar-renewable-curtailment-energy-wasted/). However, this is not only a problem in China, [Germany](https://energytransition.org/2015/11/renewable-power-curtailment-in-germany/)  and the United States have this issue as well. [Texas alone has on average between 8% and 17% wind energy curtailment](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60983.pdf). In the age of fossil fuels and non-renewables these would be wonderful statistics, but in the use-it-or-lose-it world of renewables this is pure waste. While storing energy in batteries and other technologies may prove sufficient in the future, today these technologies simply can not meet our demands in all cases and finding a use for this power may be the best solution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computing power isn't the first thing that comes up in conversation when someone mentions non-renewable resources at a party, but it is wasted at an extraordinary rate and is one of the great losses of our age. [In 2015 it was caculated that we could have around 1 sextillion flops (Floating Point Operations per Second), or 1 zetaflop of total computational capacity on the planet](https://aiimpacts.org/global-computing-capacity/). To put that into perspective, the worlds fastest super computer as of Feburary 2018 has just 0.000093% the capacity of all of the computers put together in the year 2015. Our best calulations show around 60% of the generalized CPU market goes into computers and handheld devices, with the average user of those electronics utilizing on average 25%-40% of the computational capcity even under heavy usage. Which means we are leaving an astonishing 150,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (150 quintillion) floating-point operations on the table every second.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are attempting to do, is help bridge the gap between the needs of the modern electrical grid and the billions of devices left sitting unused. We do this by utilizing one of mankind's newest technologies, the "Proof-of-Work" crypto-currency.

### The Technical Bit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crypto-currencies are a new type of internet protocol similar to [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) and [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) used for synchronizing data across many servers. One of the main features that these protocols enable are a new immutable data-type, a type of data that once propagated to the network can never again be edited.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Crypto-currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) have found different ways to make this new immutable data-type possible, however we are focusing on one type in particular, referred to commonly as ["Proof-of-Work"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system). In this type of crypto-currency the data is verified by solving complex mathematical equations  with your electronic device's processor. These math problems are designed in a way that they cannot be solved without using a statistical average amount of processing power. The data is also propagated in an hierarchical fashion designed so that in order to change a piece of data on the network one would need more computing power than the sum of all of the computing power it took to solve the math problems associated with the each piece of data propagated after the data being changed. This means, to change any bit of data on the network you need more than 50% of the total computational power of the network and maintain at least 50% of the computational power of the network for the amount of time that has alapsed since the data you would like to change was propagated to the network. This is refered to as a [51% attack](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp). This is highly unlikly, made clear by the fact that the current leading crypto-currency, Bitcoin's network is [eight times more powerfull than the top five-hundred super-computers combined](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-network-out-muscles-top-500-supercomputers/). A single group of people controlling even half that amount of computing power would be impossible, as the amount of energy needed to change data even minutes old could require as much electricity as most businesses comusme in a year. In other words it is a free-market paradoxical approach for security, the more people who want to change the data, the harder it is for anyone to change it.

### Putting It All Together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you press the "PLAY" button on our [home](https://hivefive.life/#MINE) page, we are using your excess computing power and electricity to solve the complex mathematical equations that secure the crypto-currencies, this is called ["mining"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE). As you may have heard, "Miners" of crypto-currencies make oodles of cash! Well, that might be the case for those that have invested millions of dollars into fancy mining equipment, but for someone mining with a cellphone or even a very high-end gaming desktop there are mere pennies to be made. Unless, that is, we all work together. We take every device running our software and combine their computing power into one massive force for change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hive-mind supercomputer works twenty-four hours a day in hopes of generating a small fortune. Which we here a **hiveFive|life** will donate **in full** to the causes that our generous users select. If you would like to submit a sugestion for a cause that is important to you, head on over to the ["CAUSES AND CHARITIES"](https://hivefive.life/#COMMUNITY) section of our forums and leave a link and as much information as possible because you have to convince the community it is a cause worth giving to.

## Donations

--------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made a promise to ourselves that we will never take any of the money that our users have raised for causes and use it for ourselves or even to keep the site running. If we can't find a way to run this community without taking money meant to better the world, then it just might not be worth doing. With that said, if you would like to contribute to things like paying the monthly web-hosting bill, helping raise money so that one day we can hire a full time programming staff, or (may god bless you) beer and pizza, every penny helps and gets us one step closer to our ultimate goal, nothing wasted. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we are only taking donations in Monero crypto-currency (see the address below). In the future we are looking forward to launching crowdfunding campaigns simlilar to Kickstarter and Patreon.
