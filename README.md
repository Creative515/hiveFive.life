> our users-base desires,  as possible. Though in the future we may
> become a for-profit institution one thing is for sure, any money either
> donated directly to one of our causes through us, or any profits we
> receive as a result of our users mining on hiveFive.life will be donated
> in full (100%) to the charities of choice.


## Style Guidlines

Our current style (or lack thereof) is for demo purposes only. However it is important that we keep the style consistent throughout the site. This helps with identifying potential bugs. It also serves as a tool to help identify places where functionality can be improved by displaying information in a consistent manor.
