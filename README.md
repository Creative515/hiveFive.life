## Roadmap
#### What?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This projects ultimate goal is to raise and donate as much money to the causes that our users select as possible.
#### Why?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I moved to Houston, TX in July of 2016. I had been interested in crypto-currencies for several years at that point, I had owned a few Bitcoin at one point, and was a quiet HODLer of BTC and LTC. About a year after moving to Texas, in August of 2017, hurricane Harvey struck Houston. About two days after the devastating flooding began, I began receiving messages from friends asking how they could help. One friend in particular's father and brother were loading boats, food, and supplies from North Carolina on the back of their family truck and bringing them the 16 hour drive to Houston to help the volunteers. I gave them as good of directions as I could to help them avoid flooded roads and to get them across the flooded bayous to the epicenter, where help was needed the most.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions taken by so many of my friends, and the spirit of everyone involved in the Harvey recovery really affected me, and got me thinking. How can I make it easier for people to contribute to causes and charities that have such an effect on peoples lives in these types of disasters?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-late 2017 I started to hear a lot about Monero, mostly due to a few talks from John Mcafee on YouTube, and after buying my first couple units of the currency I started to read the news more. More and more, I heard stories of this awful little *"malware"* called CoinHive that allowed you to mine Monero using Javascript, in the web-browser.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it's cliche but, that's when it hit me, zero effort donations to charity. Nearly everyone in the developed world has excess computing power literally at their fingertips. What if we could turn that power into money for those who need it most? A site that you can visit and simply press play, and change the world. That is the vision behind HiveFive.Life.
#### How?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve our "what" we will need to spend a lot of money, hiring developers, marketing, and generally running a business. However, we do not want to use the money that was set aside for the causes in order to fund our own self-interest. So we will instead give users points for every accepted hash and these points can be used to purchase special offers from our affiliates and sponsors. The money earned from our users cashing in those points and purchasing the deals from our affiliates will be the funds that will pay for our continued existence. Meaning that we can guarantee that the funds raised for the causes will always go to the causes 100% in full. 


## Style Guidlines

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current style (or lack thereof) is for demo purposes only. However it is important that we keep the style consistent throughout the site. This helps with identifying potential bugs. It also serves as a tool to help identify places where functionality can be improved by displaying information in a consistent manor.

### Color Pallet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/blackMagic.png" width="15" height="15" /><img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/sweetCorn.png" width="15" height="15" /><img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/turbo.png" width="15" height="15" /><img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/goldenBrown.png" width="15" height="15" /><img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/grandis.png" width="15" height="15" />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our style consist of a five color Honeybee pallet, <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/sweetCorn.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Sweet Corn**" #FFE57A, <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/blackMagic.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Black Magic**" #362A0B, <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/turbo.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Turbo**" #FFC920, <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/goldenBrown.png" width="15" height="15" />  "**Golden Brown**" #865E00, and <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/grandis.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Grandis**" #FFCF6E.

 1. <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/blackMagic.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Black Magic**" #362A0B is the primary background color throughout the site and therefore should be used sparingly outside of it's use as a background color.
 2. <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/sweetCorn.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Sweet Corn**" #FFE57A should be used as the primary text color throughout the site.
 3. <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/turbo.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Turbo**" #FFC920 is the primary accent color and is primarily used for borders, or where emphasis should be provided.
 4. <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/goldenBrown.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Golden Brown**" #865E00 is a soft secondary accent and should be used sparingly throughout the site.
 5. <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/grandis.png" width="15" height="15" />  "**Grandis**" #FFCF6E is a soft secondary accent and should be used sparingly throughout the site.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section we will go over the sections of the website as well as each sections purpose, terminology, and elements. This will allow for easier and more accurate communication when discussing which changes and improvements should be applied to which area.
#### Main Page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea behind the Main Page is to take the Google approach, except instead of the logo and a search-bar, the first thing you see when you go to the site is our logo and a "play" button so the users can immediately dive mining, removing as much resistance to our end goal (generating money for the causes) as possible.
##### The Miner Status Bar
![Miner Status Bar](http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/minerStatus.png)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miner status bar is, for now, a temporary fixture for demo purposes and to prove the miner is working for debugging purposes. The end goal of the website is to have as clean of an index page as possible, we don't want the users to have to think about their computer specs and how to improve their hash rate, we want it to be easy.
##### Logo
![Miner Status Bar](http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/logo.png)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the best logo, I have to admit that, but something I sketched up in about 15 minutes. Oh well, It is a decent placeholder for now.
##### Equalizer
![Miner Status Bar](http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/equalizer.png)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the mining equalizer is to give the users feedback on their mining without directly showing them stats. We don't want to discourage users to not mine because the hash rate on a particular machine is better than the one they are using. Since we want everyone mining no matter what, this animation fulfills several purposes:

 1.  Provides the necessary feedback that the miner is functional.
 2. Speeds up and slows down relative to the total hash rate.
 3.  Flashes from <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/sweetCorn.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Sweet Corn**" #FFE57A to <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/turbo.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Turbo**" #FFC920 in the event that a hash was accepted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future I would like to add the following functionality:

 1. Expand the number of layers dependent on the number of threads in use.
 2. Any other ideas are welcome
##### Footer Navigation
![Miner Status Bar](http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/footer.png)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This element is pretty straightforward, navigation at the bottom for easier navigation on mobile. All buttons should have a <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/blackMagic.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Black Magic**" #362A0B background, a 1px <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/turbo.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Turbo**" #FFC920 border, and the default <img src="http://opticaltortuosity.com/hivefive/images/readMe/sweetCorn.png" width="15" height="15" /> "**Sweet Corn**" #FFE57A font color.
