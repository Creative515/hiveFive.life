# Our Mission

​	At **hiveFive|life** we believe that there is an abundance of technological power, electricity, and willingness to help one another that goes unused everyday. These, for the most part, are non-renewable resources and need to be treated as such. That's why we have taken it upon ourselves to help in expanding the efficiency of these resources to 100%. Nothing wasted.
# Our Product
​	Sticking with our mission, our first product claims the unused technological power and electricity form our home computers, cellphones, business computers and other electronic devices and uses it to mine for cryptocurrencies. 

​	Mining is a process that uses our users extra computing power to secure cryptocurrency transactions. For the added security, users of the cryptocurrencies pay us small fees in return. A single desktop computer mining alone on a cryptocurrency network can sometimes generate a few cent (USD) a month, but by aggregating together hundreds or thousands of computers and other devices we hope generate substantial fees from the cryptocurrencies network. 

​	Again, in sticking with our mission, one of the key resources that we believe is going unused is peoples willingness to help one another. So, to make use of this resource we have decided to give all of the fees collected form our users mining to a cause that our users select.

## The Process

​	First, users submit causes that they would like to see donated to as a comment in our forums found at the "COMMUNITY!" page. After going through a quick reviewing process, nearing the end of our five month "round" we will create a poll on the forum where users can vote for the causes they want to see make it to the front page. Lastly, the top-five cause from the forum poll will make it to the front page poll, where over the course of the next five months there will be a continuous competition to see which cause will receive the lions-share of the donations.
